# CN Navbar

Part of our codenation course was to experiment with creating a responsive navbar, as introduction to the need for media queries across the various devices it might be viewed on.

I managed to achieve a good aesthetic, and added some nice animations pulled in from Ian Lunns Hover.css, also added some of my own social links.

No Javascript was used.
